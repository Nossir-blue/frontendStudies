    <p>Hello, World!</p>
    <p>Today i am at Lukeny's house, we decided that i'd spend the weekend here. To be honest, it's pretty cozy here
        Seeing his interaction with his grandmother made me think on how i should be with my grandparents
        Unfortunately i am a disgrace as a person, i didn't value the times i had with her, i just kept complaining day in and day out until she passed.
        I really hope i change
